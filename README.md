# bookshelf

This is the repository to build test application named "Bookshelf" as learning java.
Application is used to organize books of user and have an overview of books owned.
In application, you can add, modify and delete books. Luckily, in some time you will be also able to search for books or list all/defined books.
All books will contain name of book, author and genre of book.
As I will proceed with learning of Java, I want to use this application as a base for webapp for more users, they will have each own account and list of books, 
where you will be able to search for book and see, which users have searched book. The idea of this webapp is, that users will be able to borrow/lend books to others and they will still have overview, where the book is.
(as I lend books to my friends and forget about it, and these books are now lost)
